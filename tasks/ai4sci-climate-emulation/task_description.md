# Climate Physics Emulation: Neural Network Architecture

## Research Question
Design an improved neural network architecture for emulating sub-grid atmospheric physics processes in climate models. Your architecture should achieve lower Normalized MSE (NMSE) than the default MLP baseline on the ClimSim low-resolution dataset.

## Background
Global climate models divide the atmosphere into grid cells, but many critical physical processes (radiation, convection, cloud formation) occur at scales smaller than these grid cells. Traditionally, these sub-grid processes are approximated by parameterization schemes -- handcrafted physics-based approximations. Neural network emulators can learn these mappings from high-resolution simulation data, potentially improving both accuracy and computational efficiency.

ClimSim provides data from the E3SM multi-scale climate model, where each sample maps an atmospheric column state to the corresponding sub-grid physics tendencies computed by the high-resolution physics module.

## Task
Modify the `Custom` model class (lines 86-118 in `custom_emulator.py`) to implement a better neural network architecture. The model must:

- Accept `input_dim` and `output_dim` in `__init__`
- Implement `forward(x)` where `x` has shape `(batch_size, input_dim)`
- Return predictions of shape `(batch_size, output_dim)`

## Interface

**Input structure** (556-dim vector per atmospheric column):
- 9 multi-level variables x 60 vertical levels = 540 features:
  temperature (state_t), specific humidity (state_q0001), cloud ice (state_q0002),
  cloud liquid (state_q0003), zonal wind (state_u), meridional wind (state_v),
  ozone (pbuf_ozone), methane (pbuf_CH4), nitrous oxide (pbuf_N2O)
- 16-17 single-level (surface/TOA) scalar variables:
  surface pressure, solar insolation, heat fluxes, wind stress, albedos,
  surface type fractions, snow depths

**Output structure** (368-dim vector):
- 6 multi-level tendency variables x 60 levels = 360 features:
  temperature tendency (ptend_t), humidity tendencies (ptend_q0001-q0003),
  wind tendencies (ptend_u, ptend_v)
- 8 single-level diagnostic outputs:
  net shortwave, longwave down, snow/rain precipitation, direct/diffuse solar

## Evaluation
- **Primary metric**: Normalized MSE (NMSE = MSE / Var(target), lower is better)
- **Secondary metrics**: R-squared (R2, higher is better), RMSE
- **Training budgets**: 30 epochs (short), 100 epochs (medium), 200 epochs (long)
- All three training budgets run in parallel; improvements should be consistent across all three
